- Social networks : online social networks, edges represent interactions between people
- Networks with ground-truth communities : ground-truth network communities in social and information networks
- Communication networks : email communication networks with edges representing communication
- Citation networks : nodes represent papers, edges represent citations
- Collaboration networks : nodes represent scientists, edges represent collaborations (co-authoring a paper)
- Web graphs : nodes represent webpages and edges are hyperlinks
- Amazon networks : nodes represent products and edges link commonly co-purchased products
- Internet networks : nodes represent computers and edges communication
- Road networks : nodes represent intersections and edges roads connecting the intersections
- Autonomous systems : graphs of the internet
- Signed networks : networks with positive and negative edges (friend/foe, trust/distrust)
- Location-based online social networks : Social networks with geographic check-ins
- Wikipedia networks, articles, and metadata : Talk, editing, voting, and article data from Wikipedia
- Temporal networks : networks where edges have timestamps
- Twitter and Memetracker : Memetracker phrases, links and 467 million Tweets
- Online communities : Data from online communities such as Reddit and Flickr
- Online reviews : Data from online review systems such as BeerAdvocate and Amazon
- Face-to-face communication networks : nodes are people and edges are face-to-face (non-online) interactions
- SNAP networks are also available from SuiteSparse Matrix Collection by Tim Davis.
